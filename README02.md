DESCRIPTION and LEARNING OUTCOME
---------------------------------
DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW:
---------------------
01-Coding Is Cool.cpp
What the program does:  This simple program outputs the message "Coding is Cool" to the console. It uses the cout statement from the standard input/output library to display the message.
Programming Techniques Used: Sequencing.

Suggested Improvements: Add comments for clarity.  Accept user input to make it interactive (e.g. ask what the user thinks about coding).  Apply string variables to store and output the message.

02 Simple Sums.cpp
What the program does:  This program declares and initialises two integer variables (8 and 10), adds them together, and prints the result.
Programming Techniques Used: Sequencing.
Suggested Improvements: Allow user input for both numbers.  Handle invalid inputs with validation.  Display step-by-step explanation of the addition using cout.

03 Biography.cpp
What the program does: Asks the user for the capital of France and compares their input to "Paris" using case-insensitive logic. Feedback is printed based on correctness.
Programming Techniques Used: Sequencing ,Selection.
Suggested Improvements:
•	Adapt it to meet assignment spec: Ask for user name, hometown, and age.
•	Use getline to handle full names properly.
•	Add data validation for age (e.g. check for numeric input).

04 Primitive Quiz.cpp
What the program does: Runs a 10-question capital city quiz, with countries shuffled using a random index array. It tracks the score and provides immediate feedback.
Programming Techniques Used:
•	Sequencing
•	Iteration (for loop)

Programming Techniques Used:
•	Sequencing
•	Selection (if-else)
•	Function with return value 
Suggested Improvements:
•	Validate that the input is a number.
•	Add logic for repeating the check or exiting.
•	Show the remainder to reinforce modulus operator concept.



LEARNING OUTCOME
--------------------------
Learning Results:- Through the coding of these 10 basic C++ programs, the following learning results were accomplished.

Simple Input and Output (I/O):How to use cin and cout to take the input from the user and display the output to the console is learned. 
Also, this includes formatting multi-line outputs and chaining outputs.

Variables and Data Types:Being able to declare and use different data types such as int, string, and bool, as well as arrays was a huge gain. 

Control Structures:Applied using if-else and switch statements, so the program makes decisions based on user input or conditions. 

Loops and Iteration:For and while loops were used to repeat actions, including counting up/down, filtering, and validating input through multiple 
attempts, in other words, they wanted to do it. 

Arrays:Together with the countries and their capitals names, arrays stored and processed a collection of items, in this example, they implemented search 
algorithms to find elements in arrays. 

String Manipulation:Realized that to control logic and input validation, string values have to be compared. 

Error Handling and Validation:To create the impression of security or user feedback some simple validation was introduced (e.g., limiting login attempts, 
detecting invalid month numbers). 

Logical Thinking and Algorithm Design:Frame the problems of reality as logic steps by using pseudocode planning before coding. 

Code Readability and Structure:Improvements in comments, indentation, and naming conventions were made to raise the code readability and maintainability, 
especially, when it comes to sharing through platforms like GitHub. 

Use of IDE (Visual Studio Code):By programming, compiling, testing, and debugging C++ programs in an efficient manner, Visual Studio Code became the 
channel to foster gain in confidence.

Completing the 10 C++ programs provided me with a firm grasp of basic coding with Visual Studio Code. Every little assignment 
was indeed a step that boosted my confidence, and this is what I have learned through the process with the 10 mini c++ coding programs.
 Having gained the concepts of the most common input and output commands in C++ namely, cin and cout, I realised the necessity 
of these commands to interact with users. I practiced how to store and manipulate data using different variable types like 
integers and strings, and I worked with swtich, and arrays to list data like names of countries and their capitals.Using control 
structures such as if, else, and switch for decision-making in my code, I’ve gained the expertise of an advanced user. 
I also discovered how to repeat tasks through loops, for example, using for when we know how many times a user will input, and while loop is used 
when we do no know how many times the user want to input. These techniques were beneficial for creating quizzes, counters, and 
password attempts, and for searching through lists of names.Programming these small apps made me learn how to logically plan in 
an orderly manner, and I have started to check and validate user inputs, so the program reacts in a user-friendly or secure way. 
This includes checking if the user typed a correct answer, or making sure they didn’t go over the number of allowed attempts.
I have also been concentrating on writing cleaner, more readable code by adding comments, using clearer names for things, 
and keeping the layout tidy. This will assist me when I go back to my work or share it with others such as GitHub uploads.The best 
part is that I’m on my way to becoming a real programmer breaking tasks down, solving problems logically, frame- working how code 
interacts in the everyday world. These exercises helped me build a strong foundation for my programming journey.  Now I am begining to think
more along the lines of whether the coding is sequencing, iteration, and/or selction? one of these or two of these or all three to be used.
Geting to know what is syntax, semantic and pragmatic was a bit learnign curve for me.  Knowledge is good, but knowledge is useless when the mind is
a mess with overload of knowledge.  Things are beginning to make some kind of sense.  I know i must do more coding practices, which I am referring 
more hours of self learning to code in C++, read back the class Power Points and do another set of note taking. 


Program Insights

Input/Output

- Programs use `cin`, `getline`, and `cout` for console-based interaction.
- `03-Biography` and `04-PrimitiveQuiz` handle full-string inputs and validation.
- Error handling via loops and `cin.fail()` to ensure clean input (especially `03`, `10`).

Control Flow

- Conditional logic (`if`, `switch`) used in exercises like `04`, `05`, `06`, `10`.
- Loop constructs (`for`, `while`) are demonstrated in exercises like `06`, `07`, `08`.

Functions

- Basic modularization in exercises `09` and `10` using user-defined functions.

---

Error Handling

- Input validation is included for all user-input-dependent programs.
- Type checking (`cin.fail()`) is used in `03-Biography` to handle non-integer age input.
- Maximum attempt handling in `06-BruteForceAttack` prevents infinite loops.

---

Reusability & Extensibility

- Each `.cpp` file can be modified independently.
- Can be expanded into multi-file projects using header files and classes.
- `04-PrimitiveQuiz` can be extended to a quiz game with a loop and question bank.

Testing Instructions

Compile and run each `.cpp` file using a C++17 compliant compiler:

```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <output>
./<output>
```

Edge cases are tested for:
- String input when integer expected (e.g., in `03`)
- Case-insensitive string comparisons (e.g., in `04`)
- Invalid month input (e.g., in `05`)
- Exceeding password attempts (e.g., in `06`)

---

Maintenance Notes

- Ensure all programs remain C++17 compatible.
- Keep consistent naming and coding conventions.
- Regular commits with descriptive messages are advised during extension or debugging.
